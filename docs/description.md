# Project Description

## Overview

This project is a command-line tool that provides users with a convenient interface for interacting with BotForge's documentation. It allows you to search for functions, events, and enums related to ForgeScript and its extensions, providing an efficient way to access detailed metadata about BotForge.

## Features

- **Search for Functions**: Look up specific functions available in BotForge, along with their descriptions, usage, and parameters.
- **Search for Events**: Easily find events such as `messageCreate` or `guildUpdate` with relevant information about their triggers.
- **Search for Enums**: Quickly retrieve enums like `LogLevel`, and get the associated values.
- **Extensions Support**: Optionally, specify an extension to limit the search to that particular extension's metadata.
- **Version Checking**: Automatically check if the installed version is the latest.

## Installation

To install the CLI tool, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @tryforge/cli
